This is my CSSBattle-solutions. URL: https://cssbattle.dev

It's an amazing-wonderful-addictive game, where you have to visually replicate "Targets" in the smallest possible CSS code and battle it out to get to the top of the leaderboard.


At first, I was very skeptic about it and thought: "Okay, I will just practice solving these targets, and I'll never be worried about
the number of symbols I used, it's silly!".

However, in further battles I participated, I found myself quite competitive in optimizing my code. For instance:
- in BATTLE #4 I'm the 52nd of 438 participants
- in a small BATTLE #5 I'm 21st of 133 participants

So I like to see my progress from the first battle and how I improved my css-skills :)
