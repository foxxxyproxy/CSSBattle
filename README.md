This is my [CSSBattle-solutions](https://cssbattle.dev)

It's an amazing-wonderful game, where you have to visually replicate "Targets" in the smallest possible CSS-code

At first, I was very skeptic about it and thought: 
>"Okay, I will just practice solving these targets, and I'll never be worried about
the number of symbols I used, it's silly!"

However, in further battles I participated, I found myself quite competitive in optimizing my code. For instance:
- I'm the 52nd of 438 participants in BATTLE #4 
- I'm 21st of 133 participants n a small BATTLE #5

So I like to see my progress from the first battle when I just tried to solve the problem and how I improved my CSS-skills :)
